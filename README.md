# 📚 Bookworm Library Management System  

The **Bookworm Library Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to **simplify and digitalize library operations**.  
Instead of relying on manual registers and spreadsheets, this system provides an **automated platform** for managing books, members, and borrowing/returning activities.  

The application is built using **React.js** for the frontend with **TailwindCSS** for styling, providing a modern and responsive UI.  
The **backend is powered by Express.js and Node.js**, with **MongoDB** as the database to store and manage records.  

This project is ideal for:  
- 📚 **Libraries and Institutions** wanting to digitize book management  
- 👨‍🎓 **Students and Developers** learning full-stack development  
- 🏫 **Small organizations or schools** that need a lightweight library system
